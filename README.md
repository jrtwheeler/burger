  ## Installation
  The app is deployed at heroku :
  ## Usage Information
  In the field burgers, enter a kind of burger and log it to the card for new burgers or devoured burgers. When a new burger has been devoured, use the button next to the burger name to change its category to devoured. When a devoured burger has been enjoyed so much that it DEMANDS a second portion, use the button next to its name to redeploy the burger to new burgers so it can be devoured again. In the unfortunate event a burger is sub satisfactory, use the trash button to destroy the burger from the lists.
